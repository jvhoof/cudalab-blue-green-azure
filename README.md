# Barracuda CloudGen Firewall and Web Application Firewall - Blue / Green deployment

## Introduction
Since the begining of time people have tried to automate tasks. Also in computer sience we have seen this from the early days. One limition was the infrastructure that needed to be in place for automation to commence. With virtualisation and public cloud this automation has come full circle and we can now deploy, manage, redeploy everything using automation techniques. We can descibe the operating environment in code, validate it, test it, document it and deploy it from a code repository. 

This is a giant change compared to the typical laborious deployment of infrastructure through cli, web ui, client or other. 

The purpose of this demo is to showcase how you can create, configure and secure your whole environment from code.

## Prerequisites
The tools used in this setup are HashiCorp Terraform (> 0.11.x) and RedHat Ansible (> 2.x). Both tools have their pro's and con's. Working together they help maintaining the state of your infrastructure and the ensures the configuration is correct. The deployment can be done from either a bash shell script or from any CI tool. In our case we used Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). The LINUX VSTS agent requires the Ansible and Terraform tools to be installed as well as the VSTS agent.

## Deployed resources
Following resources will be created by this deployment per color:
- One virtual network with CGF, WAF, WEB and SQL subnets
- Routing for the WEB and SQL subnets
- One CGF virtual machine with a network interface and public IP in a Availability Set
- One WAF virtual machine with a network interface and public IP in a Availability Set
- One WEB Linux virtual machine with a network interface
- One SQL Linux virtual machine with a network interface
- Two external Azure Basic Load Balancer, containing either the CGF or WAF virtual machines with a public IP and services for HTTP, HTTPS IPSEC and/or TINA VPN tunnels
- Azure Traffic Manager to switch from Blue to Green deployment and back

## Launching the Template

Ideally the deployment of the Blue or Green environments is done using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or another CI/CD tools. In this reference architecture we used VSTS. The deployment is also possible from a CLI that provides the Terraform and Ansible tools. Within Azure this is certainly possible with the Azure Cloud Shell which contains both.

The package provides a deploy.sh and destroy.sh scripts which will build or remove the whole setup per color when the correct arguments are supplied as well as the correct environment variables are set. For VSTS you can find the build configuration files in the resources/vsts directory. For CLI we recommand the deployment from the Azure Cloud Shell as this comes pre-installed with the reqiured tools. 

For the Barracuda CGF it is also required to have a Barracuda CloudGen Firewall Control Center ready to go. This Control Center

## Detailed deployment & configuration steps

The deployment using VSTS is done is different steps. From a network point of view the configuration from the Barracuda CloudGen Firewall is pulled from the Firewall Control Center On-Premise. This contains the whole configuration of the CloudGen Firewall and will automatically establish a TINA VPN tunnel between the On-Premise site and the new deployment. All Ansible configuration is done over this TINA VPN tunnel. The public footprint of this deployment is as such reduced to only the public websites. After the deployment the demo websites are available via the URL https://azure.cudalab.eu/
